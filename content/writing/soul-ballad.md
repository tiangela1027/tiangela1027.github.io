summary: "Dancing to a song that never ends." 

---

alone he dances, arms poised<br> 
to embrace his demons, all of them<br>
slaves to the lonely, lonely waltz

deaf to familiar lyrics, familiar<br> 
only to an isolated pulse, they succumb<br>
five feet under with hardly a sound

sadness soaked into the carpet,<br>
regret blasting from a sole speaker,<br>
shadows swaying slowly to the despair

in slow circles, pale limbs posed, in silence<br>

<br>

chin raised, closed eyes,<br>
still heart

they captured him, alive<br> 
in the viewfinder, with bated breath,<br> 
in a monochrome world

a fixture to the window, behind his lonely throne,<br>
unmoved by worship, pleas,<br>
or sorrow 

time flows, streaming, like<br> 
rays seeped in from drawn curtains,<br>
poured into the cracks of stone-cold skin

like blood rivers of fallen statues, hollowed,<br>
forgotten do the drops of light cascade<br>
down his face

it is as the sun fails to rise,<br>
and he falls, soundless, that he wonders <br>
if this is the right side of heaven

yet feet dragging along in the uncertain<br> 
silence, still they dance to the soul<br> 
ballad that never ends
