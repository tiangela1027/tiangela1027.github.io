summary: "About me." 

---

I'm a software engineer with a passion for cloud-based development based in Vancouver, BC. My main areas of focus are DevOps and Cloud, where I have worked in the field of DevOps for 4+ years.

I graduated as a Computer Science major from the UBC Bachelor of Science program. I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA) exam in August 2023 and the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam in February 2024. I'm currently studying for the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam, which I'll be taking in 2025.

My favourite tools currently are Terraform and Kubernetes. I like working with Linux and writing scripts in Python or Golang, as well as solving and optimizing interesting infrastructure problems. Continually learning about and becoming more proficient in new and existing technologies is a massive passion of mine.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, where I'll read anything from auto-biographies to mystery novels, and watching whatever's currently playing in the cinema, from blockbusters to indie films. I also like to spend my evenings playing music, where I have played the piano since I was six years old and I picked up the violin since September 2022.

I also make music, please feel free to give me a listen under my artist name [Make Night](https://linktr.ee/make.night).

This section gathers pieces I've written over the years, ranging from short stories to poems. Most are works of fiction and reflect some aspect of myself through adolescence.
